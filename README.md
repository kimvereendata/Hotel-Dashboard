## üìä Objective 1: Forecast Monthly Revenue

**Goal**: Predict monthly room revenue trends for Le Meridien to support staff planning and sales strategy.

### Power BI Steps:

**1. Created a Date Table**

```DAX
DateTable = CALENDAR(MIN('Hotels Data Clean'[arrival_date]), MAX('Hotels Data Clean'[departure_date]))
```

**2. Supporting Columns**

```DAX
Year = YEAR('DateTable'[Date])
Month = FORMAT('DateTable'[Date], "MMMM")
MonthNumber = MONTH('DateTable'[Date])
YearMonth = FORMAT('DateTable'[Date], "YYYY-MM")
```

* Marked as a Date Table
* Created a relationship with `'Hotels Data Clean'[arrival_date]`

**3. Total Sales Measure**

```DAX
Total Sales = SUM('Hotels Data Clean'[sales])
```

**4. Line Chart Visualization**

* X-axis: `DateTable[YearMonth]`
* Y-axis: `Total Sales`
* Forecast Length: 12 months (using Analytics pane)

**Insight**: The Studio Room leads with \~\$520,948 in forecasted sales, while the Royal Suite trails at \~\$126,579.

## üìà Objective 2: Predict Staff Requirements Based on Booking Patterns

**Goal**: Estimate staff needs based on monthly booking trends to support efficient scheduling.

### Power BI Steps:

**1. Relationship:**

* Linked `'DateTable'[Date]` to `'Hotels Data Clean'[arrival_date]`

**2. Total Bookings Measure**

```DAX
Total Bookings = COUNTROWS('Hotels Data Clean')
```

**3. Estimated Staff Measure**

```DAX
Estimated Staff Required = ROUNDUP([Total Bookings] / 5, 0)
```

**4. Area Chart Visualization**

* X-axis: `DateTable[YearMonth]`
* Y-axis: `Estimated Staff Required`
* Slicers: `room_type`, `hotel_name`
* Trend Line added

**Insight**: Studio room bookings peak in January, March, June, and September, requiring \~43 staff during high-demand periods.

## üîç Objective 3: Segment Analysis for Targeted Marketing

**Goal**: Analyze customer segment contributions to sales by room type to enable targeted marketing.

### Power BI Steps:

**1. Total Sales Measure**

```DAX
Total Sales = SUM('Hotels Data Clean'[sales])
```

**2. Stacked Column Chart**

* X-axis: `customer_segment`
* Y-axis: `Total Sales`
* Legend: `room_type`
* Slicers: `booking_channel`, `region`, `room_type`

**Insight**: Corporate segment leads with over \$6.5M in total sales, but no bookings were recorded for the Royal Suite. Opportunity exists to promote luxury options to this high-value group.

## üìä Objective 4: Booking Channel Performance

**Goal**: Identify the most profitable booking channel and evaluate the cost of discounts offered.

### Power BI Steps:

**1. Created Core Measures**

```DAX
Total Nights = SUM('Hotels Data Clean'[nights])
Total Discount = SUM('Hotels Data Clean'[disc_amt])
Total Sales = SUM('Hotels Data Clean'[sales])
```

**2. Visualizations**

* **Clustered Bar Chart**

  * Y-axis: `MonthLabel`
  * X-axis: `Total Nights`
  * Legend: `booking_channel`
* **Stacked Area Chart**

  * X-axis: `booking_channel`
  * Y-axis: `Total Discount`

**3. Additional Elements**

* Slicers for `hotel_name`, `room_type`
* Table: `customer_segment` vs. `Total Nights`
* Card: Total Nights Booked

**Insight**: Booking.com drives the highest room-night revenue (~~\$54K) but also requires the most discount spending (~~\$54K). Direct bookings are the most cost-efficient, with the lowest nights and discount spend (\~\$48K and \~\$45K respectively).
